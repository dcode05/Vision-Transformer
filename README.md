In this readme,
1. I have shared a link to the Colab Notebook file where almost every step of the code has been explained: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xuzdjLxG2vKHig28pyPP1QOibrOqVmUp?usp=sharing
2. I have shared notes where each Class explained in the class has been summarized clearly. The last 2 images show the change in matrix sizes as the data flows among various classes.
